# SweeperBots
This Repo keeps a track of sweeper bots out their who monitor memepool and withdraw gas from leaked private keys

Addresses included here are found on a pattern of transactions, If you have an outgoing transaction to these wallet address it means you have a sweeper bot on your address
So far, We have found these bots are hard to beat because of their gas fee input which is 10X than usual. 
Thanks to https://www.blocknative.com who helps us monitor memepool.

As seen from transaction history of bots we see addresses who own ENS domains are also being sweeped
We will keep adding more addresses!
